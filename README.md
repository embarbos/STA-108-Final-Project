# crime-and-demographic-data-analysis
Hello!
This is the Final Project for my Applied Statistical Methods: Regression Analysis Class (STA 108 at UC Davis).
In this project, we used data from the 440 most populous counties in the United States, with each entry listing data on 17 socioeconomic variables, to analyze various factors that can contribute to a county's number of serious crimes. Each of the 440 counties has been categorized into a larger general geographic reigon, numbered 1-4, for the sake of brevity. In my analysis, I am regressing 5 of the socioeconomic variables to the prevalence of crime per county: per capita income, percent of population unemployed, percent of population below the poverty line, percent of population with a bachelors degree, and percent of population that have a high school diploma.
In this repository, I will also include the knitted .pdf file which shows the final conclusions.
Thank you!
